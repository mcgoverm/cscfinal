		<p>Rowing is one of the oldest and most prestigious sports on the planet, with evidence suggesting 
		the first rowing races may have occurred as long ago as the Egyptian era. Oxford and Cambridge University 
		organised a competitive rowing race in 1828, and the two education facilities still compete against one 
		another to this day. The objective of rowing is simple: the boat that reaches the finish line first is declared 
		the winner of the race. Reaching the finish line in the quickest possible time requires an astonishing 
		amount of physical and mental strength, high levels of stamina and seamless synchronisation when competing 
		in team events.</p>

			<div><h3>Types of Rowing</h3>
			<p>There are two types of ways that you can race. You can either: sweep or scull. Sweeping occurs 
			with one oar, people normally are rowing with their dominant hand because the inside hand feathers 
			and the ouside hand controls your hand through the stroke. While in sculling,You have an oar in both 
			hands.</p>
			<p>People can race in a variety of boats. Depending on the amount of people rowing, you can be in a 
			boat alone or with 8 people at most. Because you are rowing on both sides, sculling can only be done in a single.
			The difference between a double and a pair is that a double is sculling, while a pair is sweeping. Some boats 
			can row without a coxswain as well, who steers the boat and coaches them.</p></div>
			<div class="line-separator" style="grid-column: 1 / -1;"></div>
			<div><h3>Who is a Coxswain?</h3>
			<p>Coxswains are typically the smallest people in the boat; most are under 5'4. While they have "cox boxes," essentially a 
			small microphone that amplifies their voice throughout the boat, they also have to be confident in their ability to lead
			their boat and their rowers. They can be especially useful because they act as the coaches of
			the boat.</p>
			<p>Generally, coxswains are most focused on keeping the rowers safe and helping them hit their
			objectives for the day. In practice, the coach will give them the workout and that is what They
			facilitate on the water. They often look out for technique and can point out changes that occur 
			microscopically in the boat. As a coxswain, you can hear, see, and feel when the boat is not 
			moving all together.</p></div>

			<div><h3>Positions in all Boats</h3>
			<p>Typically, positions only matter in boats of 8 or 4 people,
			these are called by their name: 8s and 4s. Starting in a 4, the
			order of the seats are: bow/1, 2, 3, stroke/4. In an 8: bow/1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
			7, stroke/8. In all boats, the ypical language used is that the seat closest to the bow
			is the bow, while the seat closest to the stern is the stroke.</p>
			<p>Bow/1 seat is the person who is in charge of the "set", thestability of the 
			boat. Every seat in the middle--2/3 in a 4 and 2/3/4/5/6/7 in an 8--are considered the most powerful.
			These rowers are less affected by the boat's movements, like the keel, and are driving to their
			maximum power output. The stroke is closest to the stern and is the seat in front of everyone. They control the rate
			and are able to hold a steady stroke to guide everyone in the boat.</p></div>
